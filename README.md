# **CAPSULE: A Snake Fork**

This is a standard Snake clone coded in Python using the Pygame library.

CAPSULE is my first major coding project that dealt with nested loops, interlinking functions with abstracted parameters, and a crash course in video game logic and design.

The code is a big mess to say the least. I didn't fully utilize the tools Python and Pygame had to offer, as such, I repeat myself a lot.

####So... It's Just Snake, Right?

The basic core of CAPSULE was built with the help of a Snake tutorial, yes, but I tweaked the design and game logic, added menus, and button logic to make the game, the UX, and the UI a bit more interesting.

For instance, this version of Snake is winnable. It's really difficult; I still haven't beaten it myself, but it can happen... if you're a robot. Also, since the game is winnable, the penalty of crossing into yourself is not an automatic "game over". Instead, the penalty is a loss of speed and levels. This is inteded to create a scenarion in the late game where the risk/reward dynamic is highlighted.

####Pfft, What Did You Learn From This, If Anything?

Game development is harder and much more involved than I thought. Like a lot.

The coding in itself was tough (being new to Python and programming in general), but designing and making every bit of graphic design was a lot more difficult than I thought.

Even planning out the game, what assets I needed, and having what I thought was a pretty good checklist didn't stop me from drowning in the project a bit.

####You Arrogant Butt.

Yeah. Well, it was fun. Or "fun". It was something.

As said before, the code is **terrible**. If any poor soul stumbles on this, they'll be greeted with pretty messy bit of code, but I tried to write some ledgible documentation to stem that.
